# Smoking-Game = your way to the grave
Smoking game is a fun game where you need to collect smokes. You should avoid snus and police cars. At the end of the game there is a princess for a brave smoking warrior. The original idea of the game was to raise awareness about dangers of smoking. That "making the world better" moment is not quite good though and the whole game can be considered as propagandizing of the bad habit.

The game is created during the course Game and Avatar Programming (IDX5060) at the Tallinn University of Technology in autumn 2014.

**NB! Level 2 is more difficult than level 1. So before saying that this game is too easy try to win level 2. :)**

# Technology & resources
Almost all sprites used in the game are drawn by me and PSD files are attached. Sounds are recorded and edited by me. List of stuff that I "borrowed" from others:

 - [Phaser v2.2.1](http://phaser.io)
 - Tilemaps created with [Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org/)
 - Scull icon is borrowed form [here](http://www.iconsdb.com/black-icons/skull-46-icon.html)
 - Player sprite is originally from [here](http://opengameart.org/content/pixel-officer), but was edited by me
 - Font originally from [here](http://www.dafont.com/8bit-wonder.font) and was converted to bitmap font using [Littera](http://kvazars.com/littera/)
